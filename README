Main classes of interest are TestRest & Boot (they are a bit different among master & other branches)
Test scenario:
1. Deploy sample app
2. in browser try access /test/get (relative to your deployment context)- you should see 'Created. Users: 0, Contacts: 0'
3. then try access /test/transaction - you'll get exception message which is expected 
4. access /test/get again - this time you'll see 'Created. Users: 1, Contacts: 0' - while expected output should be the same as in step 2

Test scenario and its outcome is the same for both master & BothLoanWrapperAndDbUse branches, while on DbUseInPlace it behaves as expected (but on this branch buildLoanWrapper is commented in Boot)
